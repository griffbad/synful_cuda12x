"""
SYNFUL MODERNIZATION: CRITICAL GAP ANALYSIS & ACTION PLAN
=========================================================

After a thorough audit of the original Synful implementation against our modernized version,
we have identified several critical gaps that must be addressed to ensure complete feature parity.

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1. MISSING GUNPOWDER PIPELINE (FIXED ✅)
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Issue**: Entire gunpowder module was missing with 6 critical custom nodes
**Solution**: Created modernized versions of all nodes:
- ✅ AddPartnerVectorMap: Complex vector field generation for synaptic partners
- ✅ Hdf5PointsSource: HDF5-based point loading for synapses  
- ✅ IntensityScaleShiftClip: Intensity normalization and clipping
- ✅ ExtractSynapses: Synapse detection from prediction arrays
- ✅ CloudVolumeSource: Cloud-based volume data loading
- ✅ UpSample: Array upsampling with scipy interpolation

### 2. OVERSIMPLIFIED TRAINING PIPELINE (CRITICAL ❌)
**Status**: CRITICAL ISSUE
**Current State**: Our PyTorch Lightning training uses synthetic data and simple loaders
**Original State**: Complex Gunpowder pipeline with:
- Multiple HDF5 data sources combined with RandomProvider
- Sophisticated augmentation chain (Elastic, Simple, Intensity, etc.)
- Custom AddPartnerVectorMap for vector field generation
- RasterizePoints for synapse location targets
- BalanceLabels for loss weighting
- PreCache with multi-worker data loading
- Snapshot-based training visualization

**ACTION REQUIRED**: 
1. Implement full Gunpowder training pipeline in PyTorch Lightning
2. Replace TensorFlow training loop with PyTorch equivalent
3. Ensure exact augmentation and data processing compatibility

### 3. OVERSIMPLIFIED PREDICTION PIPELINE (CRITICAL ❌) 
**Status**: CRITICAL ISSUE
**Current State**: Simple chunked prediction with basic synapse detection
**Original State**: Sophisticated Daisy blockwise processing with:
- MongoDB coordination for distributed processing
- Worker management with job queuing systems
- ROI-based chunking with proper context handling
- Multiple output datasets with different data types
- Database tracking of completion status
- Configurable worker pools and resource management

**ACTION REQUIRED**:
1. Implement Daisy blockwise processing for large volume prediction
2. Add MongoDB coordination for distributed workflows
3. Implement proper worker management and job scheduling
4. Add comprehensive output dataset management

### 4. INCOMPLETE DATA LOADING INFRASTRUCTURE (CRITICAL ❌)
**Status**: CRITICAL ISSUE  
**Current State**: Basic zarr + TSV loading
**Required State**: Multi-format data loading with:
- Multiple zarr files with coordinate mapping
- Multiple cubes within each zarr file
- HDF5 file support for legacy compatibility
- TSV synapse coordinate transformation
- Proper ROI handling and coordinate system management
- CloudVolume integration for cloud-based data

**ACTION REQUIRED**:
1. Implement multi-zarr coordinate mapping system
2. Add support for multiple cubes per zarr with proper indexing
3. Integrate HDF5 data sources for compatibility
4. Enhance TSV coordinate transformation handling

### 5. DEPENDENCY MODERNIZATION GAPS (MODERATE ❌)
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Issues Found**:
- gunpowder.contrib.points imports need updating for modern Gunpowder
- gunpowder.profiling.Timing class may have changed
- CloudVolume integration optional dependency handling
- MongoDB client integration for coordination

**ACTION REQUIRED**:
1. Fix Gunpowder import compatibility issues
2. Implement proper optional dependency handling
3. Update MongoDB integration for modern PyMongo
4. Ensure all dependencies work with Python 3.12+

### 6. MISSING FEATURE COMPLETENESS TESTING (CRITICAL ❌)
**Status**: NOT STARTED
**Current State**: Basic functionality testing only
**Required State**: Comprehensive testing ensuring:
- Identical output between original and modernized versions
- All augmentation transformations produce same results
- Coordinate systems and ROI handling work identically
- Training convergence matches original implementation
- Prediction accuracy is equivalent

**ACTION REQUIRED**:
1. Create comprehensive test suite comparing original vs modernized
2. Implement numerical accuracy validation
3. Add performance benchmarking
4. Create regression testing for all pipeline components

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### HIGH PRIORITY (Must Fix Before Production Use)
1. **Training Pipeline**: Current training is fundamentally different from original
2. **Prediction Pipeline**: Missing distributed processing capabilities  
3. **Data Loading**: Cannot handle real-world multi-volume datasets
4. **Testing**: No validation of functional equivalence

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Important for Full Compatibility)
1. **Dependency Updates**: May cause import/compatibility issues
2. **Coordinate Systems**: Need exact compatibility with original
3. **Performance**: Ensure no regression in processing speed

### LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)
1. **Code Documentation**: Enhanced documentation for modern users
2. **Additional Visualizations**: Beyond original capabilities
3. **Modern Python Features**: Type hints, async support, etc.

## RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (Days 1-3)
1. Fix Gunpowder import compatibility issues
2. Implement full Gunpowder training pipeline in PyTorch Lightning
3. Integrate Daisy blockwise processing for prediction
4. Implement multi-zarr data loading infrastructure

### Phase 2: FEATURE COMPLETENESS (Days 4-5)  
1. Add MongoDB coordination for distributed processing
2. Implement comprehensive testing suite
3. Validate numerical accuracy against original
4. Performance benchmarking and optimization

### Phase 3: PRODUCTION READINESS (Day 6)
1. Final integration testing
2. Documentation updates
3. Example workflows and tutorials
4. Deployment verification

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- ✅ All original Gunpowder nodes functional in modern pipeline
- ✅ Training produces identical results to original implementation
- ✅ Prediction handles large volumes with distributed processing
- ✅ Multi-zarr and multi-cube data loading works seamlessly
- ✅ All tests pass with numerical accuracy validation
- ✅ Performance meets or exceeds original implementation
- ✅ Complete documentation and examples provided

## RISK MITIGATION

**Risk**: Breaking existing functionality while adding features
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing at each step, separate development branches

**Risk**: Performance regression due to PyTorch overhead
**Mitigation**: Profiling and optimization, comparison benchmarks

**Risk**: Dependency conflicts with modern packages
**Mitigation**: Virtual environment testing, optional dependencies

**Risk**: Coordinate system incompatibilities
**Mitigation**: Extensive validation against original test cases
